# Detecting-Cyclone-Centers-Custom-YOLOv3
TROPICAL cyclones (TCs) are intense warm-corded cyclonic vortices, developed from low-pressure systems over the tropical oceans and driven by complex air-sea interaction. Recent trend analysis based on both archive data and future projections consistently suggest an increase of the mean intensity of global TCs over coming decades, although there could be a decrease in TC frequency. Here, satellite images are taken as input to get cyclone center points that is region of lowest pressure.
